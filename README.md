# Freestanding DIY Climbing Wall

## :boom: DISCLAIMER :boom:

I don't know how to build climbing walls or hold a saw. If you build this and hurt yourself, that's on you.

## Usage

Install [Anaconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) and type

```buildoutcfg
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate climbing-wall
python gui.py
```

## Whouldn't it have been easier to use *any* CAD system directly?

:fu: Yes, I was bored, ok?

## Contributing

Give me carpentry advice or write a PR.
