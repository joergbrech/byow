# Freestanding DIY Climbing Wall

## :boom: DISCLAIMER :boom:

I don't know how to build climbing walls or hold a saw. If you build this and hurt yourself, that's on you.

## Usage

Install [Anaconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) and type

```buildoutcfg
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate climbing-wall
python diy_climbing_wall.py
```
