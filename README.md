# Build Your Own Freestanding DIY Climbing Wall

## :boom: DISCLAIMER :boom:

I don't know how to build climbing walls or hold a saw. If you build this and hurt yourself, that's on you.

## Installation

Install [Anaconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) and type

```buildoutcfg
conda install byow -c joergbrech -c dlr-sc
```

into your anaconda command prompt/shell.

## Usage

Enter
```buildoutcfg
byow
```
into your anaconda command prompt/shell to start the climbing wall configurator. Choose your parameters and build your wall.
For another wall configuration you need to modify the code.

## Whouldn't it have been easier to use *any* CAD system directly?

:fu: I was bored, ok?
